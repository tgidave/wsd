WIND SPEED AND DIRECTION SYSTEM

This is the code development directory structure for the Wind Speed and Direction display.

The directory structure is make up of four subdirectoried:

wsd_publish - the code for the sensor devices.
wsd_subscribe - the code for the gallery devices.
include - include files common to both the sensor and the gallery code.
lib - library functions used by the sensor and/or the gallery code.

There are also Makefiles in both the wsd_publish and wsd_subscribe directories.  They are used
to build the code and flash the devices.  See the comments at the beginnig of each file for
information on how to use them.

I hope all this works.  Let me know if you find a problem.
